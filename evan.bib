  abstract = {Association rules are a widely used technique to generate recommendations
	in commercial and research recommender systems. Since more and more
	Web sites, especially of retailers, offer automatic recommender services
	using Web usage mining, evaluation of recommender algorithms becomes
	increasingly important. In this paper we first present a framework
	for the evaluation of different aspects of recommender systems based
	on the process of discovering knowledge in databases of Fayyad et
	al. and then we focus on the comparison of the performance of two
	recommender algorithms based on frequent itemsets. The first recommender
	algorithm uses association rules, and the other recommender algorithm
	is based on the repeat-buying theory known from marketing research.
	For the evaluation we concentrated on how well the patterns extracted
	from usage data match the concept of useful recommendations of users.
	We use 6 month of usage data from an educational Internet information
	broker and compare useful recommendations identified by users from
	the target group of the broker with the results of the recommender
	algorithms. The results of the evaluation presented in this paper
	suggest that frequent itemsets from purchase histories match the
	concept of useful recommendations expressed by users with satisfactory
	accuracy (higher than 70\%) and precision (between 60\% and 90\%).
	Also the evaluation suggests that both algorithms studied in the
	paper perform similar on real-world data if they are tuned properly.},

In order to improve recommender quality, we argue that recommenders need a deeper understanding of users and their information seeking tasks. Human-Recommender Interaction (HRI) provides a framework and a methodology for understanding users, their tasks, and recommender algorithms using a common language. Further, by using an analytic process model, HRI becomes not only descriptive, but also constructive. It can help with the design and structure of a recommender system, and it can act as a bridge between user information seeking tasks and recommender algorithms.</p>},

  abstract = {Mining association rules is an important technique for discovering
	meaningful patterns in transaction databases. Many different measures
	of interestingness have been proposed for association rules. However,
	these measures fail to take the probabilistic properties of the mined
	data into account. In this paper, we start with presenting a simple
	probabilistic framework for transaction data which can be used to
	simulate transaction data when no associations are present. We use
	such data and a real-world database from a grocery outlet to explore
	the behavior of confidence and lift, two popular interest measures
	used for rule mining. The results show that confidence is systematically
	influenced by the frequency of the items in the left hand side of
	rules and that lift performs poorly to filter random noise in transaction
	data. Based on the probabilistic framework we develop two new interest
	measures, hyper-lift and hyper-confidence, which can be used to filter
	or order mined association rules. The new measures show significantly
	better performance than lift for applications where spurious rules
	are problematic. },
